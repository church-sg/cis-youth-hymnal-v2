  <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
In Christ alone my hope is found,<br>
He is my light, my strength, my song;<br>
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,<br>
Firm through the fercest drought and storm.<br>
What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br>
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br>
My Comforter, my All in All,<br>
Here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
In Christ Alone! Who took on flesh,<br>
Fullness of God in helpless babe.<br>
Theis gift of love anad righteousness,<br>
Scorned by the ones He came to save:<br>
Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br>
The wrath of God was satisfied -<br>
For every sin on Him was laid;<br>
Here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
There in the ground His body lay,<br>
Light of the world by darkness slain:<br>
Then bursting forth in glorious day<br>
Up from the grave He rose again!<br>
And as He stands in victory<br>
Sin&rsquo;s curse has lost its grip on me,<br>
For I am his His and He is mine -<br>
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 4</strong><br>
No guilt in life, no fear in death,<br>
This is the power of Christ in me;<br>
From life&rsquo;s first cry to final breath,<br>
Jesus commands my destiny.<br>
No power of hell, no scheme of man,<br>
Can ever pluck me from His hand:<br>
Till He returns or calls me home,<br>
Here in the power of Christ I&rsquo;ll stand.</p>
