    <div class="lyrics"><p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,<br>
He came to love, heal and forgive;<br>
He lived and died, to buy my pardon,<br>
An empty grave is there to prove My Savior lives.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,<br>
Because He lives, all fear is gone<br>
Because I know (I know) He holds the future<br>
And life is worth the living just because He lives.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
The Son of God, He paid my ransom;<br>
Went to the cross, my sins to bear.<br>
No greater love! His life He laid down;<br>
He died for me and thus forever set me free.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br>
Now I serve Him, my living Saviour;<br>
I walk with Him from day to day.<br>
He leads me on the heavâ€™nly pathway;<br>
I know He keeps me in the shadow of His wings.</p>
<p><em>(Stanza 1 &amp; Chorus by Gloria Gaither &amp; William J. Gaithe / Ref: John 14:19)<br>
(Stanza 2 &amp; 3 by S.H. Tow)</em></p>
