drought and storm What heights of love what depths of peace when fears are stilled when strivings cease My Comforter my All in All Here in the love of Christ I stand Verse 2 In Christ Alone Who took on flesh Fullness of God in helpless babe This gift of love and righteousness Scorned by the ones He came to save Till on that cross as Jesus died The wrath of God was satisfied For every sin on Him was laid Here in the death of Christ I live Verse 3 There in the ground His body lay Light of the world by darkness slain Then bursting forth in glorious day Up from the grave He rose again And as He stands in victory Sins curse has lost its grip on me For I am his His and He is mine Bought with the precious blood of Christ Verse 4 No guilt in life no fear in death This is the power of Christ in me From lifes first cry to final breath Jesus commands my destiny No power of hell no scheme of man Can ever pluck me from His hand Till He returns or calls me home Here in the power of Christ Ill stand"}]
