**Verse**  
I just keep calling O Lord, as I walk along.  
I just keep calling O Lord, and He gives a song.  
Tho’ the storm clouds darken the sky o’er the heav’nly trail,  
I just keep calling O Lord, He will never fail!

**Chorus**  
He’s a faithful Friend, such a faithful Friend.  
I can count on Him to the very end!
Tho’ the storm-clouds darken the sky o’er the heav’nly trail,  
I just keep calling, O Lord, He will never fail!
