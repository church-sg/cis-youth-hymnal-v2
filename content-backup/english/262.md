**Verse**  
When I look into Your holiness,  
When I gaze into Your loveliness,  
When all things that surround become shadows  
in the light of You.

When Iâ€™ve found the joy of reaching Your heart,  
When my will becomes enthroned in Your love,  
When all things that surround become shadows  
in the light of You.

**Chorus**  
I worship You, I worship You,  
The reason I live is to worship you.  
I worship You, I worship You,  
The reason I live is to worship you.
