**Verse 1**  
There’s a new world somewhere  
We call the Promise Land,  
And I’ll be there someday,  
Since Jesus holds my hand.  
He is always there beside me  
In all things that I do,  
For I know I’ll never find a Friend so true.

**Chorus**  
It’s a long, long journey so stay by my side.  
When I walk through the storm,  
Lord, be my Guide, be my Guide.  
If they gave me a fortune,  
My pleasure would be small.  
I could lose it all tomorrow,  
And never mind at all.  
But if I should lose my way Lord,  
You’ll show me what to do,  
For I know I’ll never find a Friend so true.

**Verse 2**  
There is always Jesus  
To guide us on the way,  
And He’ll lead us someday,  
Where angels sing they say.  
If I should search the whole world over,  
Until life is through,  
I do know I’ll never find a Friend so true.
