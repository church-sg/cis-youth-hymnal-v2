**Verse 1**  
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God  
And His righteousness  
And all these things shall be added unto you  
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

**Verse 2**  
Man shall not live by bread alone  
But by every word  
That proceeds from the mouth of God  
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

**Verse 3**  
Ask and it shall be given unto you  
Seek and you shall find  
Knock and it shall be opened unto you  
Hallelu, Hallelujah
