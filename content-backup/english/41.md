**Verse 1**  
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,  
He came to love, heal and forgive;  
He lived and died, to buy my pardon,  
An empty grave is there to prove My Savior  
lives.

**Chorus**  
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,  
Because He lives, all fear is gone  
Because I know (I know) He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

**Verse 2**  
The Son of God, He paid my ransom;  
Went to the cross, my sins to bear.  
No greater love! His life He laid down;  
He died for me and thus forever set me free.

**Verse 3**  
Now I serve Him, my living Saviour;  
I walk with Him from day to day.  
He leads me on the heavâ€™nly pathway;  
I know He keeps me in the shadow of His wings.
