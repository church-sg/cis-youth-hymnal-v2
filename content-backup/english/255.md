**Verse 1**  
Come and see the beauty of the Lord.  
Come and know the wonder of His grace.  
Come and see how much He cares for you,  
Gaze at the compassion in His face.

**Verse 2**  
Come and touch the nail prints in His hands.  
Find the friend who truly understands  
Come and stand beneath the blood-stained cross,  
Proof of His unchanging love for us.

**Chorus**  
He is worthy, worthy of our praise!  
He is worthy, worthy of our praise!  
He is glorious, He is wonderful.  
He is everything to me.

**Verse 3**  
Come and see the stone’s been rolled away.  
The tomb is empty where His body lay.  
Why seek the living One among the dead?  
You won’t find Jesus there because He lives!
