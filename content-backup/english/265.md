**Verse 1**  
I was made to praise You,  
I was made to glorify Your name  
In every circumstance,  
To find a chance to thank You.  
I was made to love You,  
I was made to worship at Your feet.  
And to obey You, Lord,  
I was made for You.

**Verse 2**  
I will always praise You,  
I will always glorify Your name  
In every circumstance,  
I'll find a chance to thank You.  
I will always love You,  
I will always worship at Your feet  
And I'll obey You, Lord,  
I was made for You.
