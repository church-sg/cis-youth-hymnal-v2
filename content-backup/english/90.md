**Verse 1**  
Father, I thank You for all that You've done.  
You gave Your Son freely for me.  
And I praise You for calling me, drawing me near.  
Out of blindness You caused me to see.

**Verse 2**  
Spirit of life, You are God's holy fire.  
You've kindled my heart with Your blaze.  
And I know You're refining me, changing my life.  
And by faith You're revealing Your ways.

**Verse 3**  
Jesus, I need You as Lord of my life.  
I give all I have unto You.  
Lord, I want to come under Your heavenly hand,  
And to praise You in all that I do.
