**Verse 1**  
If you're feeling lonely with many a care,  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is there!  
If trouble, confusion puts your life in night,  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is Light!  
  
**Chorus 1**  
If you turn to Him,  
From within,  
Burdens He'll share;  
It matters not who you are,  
Jesus is there.  
  
**Verse 2**  
So don't wait for answers from some place, somehow;  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is Now!  
  
**Chorus 2**  
If you call on Him,  
From within,  
You just can't miss!  
And when problems torment you,  
Just remember this:  
  
In all situations this world can afford,  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is Lord!
