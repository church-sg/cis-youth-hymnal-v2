**Verse 1**  
I want to be Your servant, Lord,  
To serve You each and every day.  
I want to give my best to You  
Approved in every way.

**Chorus**  
Make my life a living sacrifice  
The way You want me to be  
To serve You with all my heart  
Whatever the cost to me.  
Take me, break me, mould me, Lord  
As the Potter shapes the clay  
Pleasing You in all I do  
Approved in every way.

**Verse 2**  
I’ll stand before Your righteous throne  
To hear “Thou good and faithful one”  
“Well done” from the Master’s lips  
Approved in every way.
