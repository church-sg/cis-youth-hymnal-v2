**Verse**  
God will make a way where there seems to be no way,  
He works in ways we cannot see,  
He will make a way for me;  
He will be my guide, hold me closely to His side,  
With love and strength for each new day,  
He will make a way, He will make a way.

**Chorus**  
By a roadway in the wilderness Heâ€™ll lead me,  
And rivers in the desert will I see;  
Heaven and earth will fade  
But His Word will still remain,  
He will do something new today.

**(Repeat Verse)**
