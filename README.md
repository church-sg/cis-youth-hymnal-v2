# CIS Youth Hymnal

This site is meant to be a successor to the reliable but (in my opinion) outdated CIS Youth Hymnal mobile app. It is also accessible through https://youthhymns.church.org.sg (accelerated through Cloudflare CDN utilizing Brotli, HTTP/3, QUIC)

## Features

- 🔍 Search hymns by number, title or lyrics
- 📱 Responsive layout for both Mobile and Desktop
- 📖 "Flip" through hymns with previous/next buttons
- ⬇️ Can be installed and/or viewed offline because it's a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)!
- ⏭️ Navigate directly to respective medleys from each hymn's page (Coming Soon!)
- 🌙 Option of Light/Dark mode (Coming Soon!)

## Tools/Dependencies

- `Hugo` for Static Site Generation
- `Grunt` for search indexing
- `Material Icons` for icons
- `jQuery` for simpler DOM manipulation
