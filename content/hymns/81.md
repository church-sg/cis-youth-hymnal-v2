**Verse 2**  
I thank You, Lord,  
For the trials that come my way,  
In that way I can grow each day,  
As I let You lead;  
And I thank You Lord,  
For the patience those trials bring,  
In the process of growing, I can learn to care.

**Chorus**  
But it goes against the way I am,  
To put my human nature down,  
And let the Spirit take control, of all I do;  
'Cause when those trials come,  
My human nature shouts the things to do,  
And God's soft prompting can be easily ignored

**Verse 2**  
But I thank You, Lord,  
With each trial I feel inside;  
That You're there to help, lead and guide  
Me away from wrong;  
'Cause You’ve promised, Lord,  
That with every testing,  
That Your way of escaping is easier to bear.

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
Yes, I thank You, Lord,  
For the vict'ry that growing brings  
In surrender of everything,  
Life is so worthwhile;  
And I thank You, Lord,  
That when everything's put in place,  
Out in front I can see Your face  
And it's there You belong.
