**Verse 1**  
You are my strength when I am weak,  
You are the treasure that I seek,  
You are my All in All.

**Verse 2**  
Seeking you as a precious jewel,  
Lord to give up I'd be a fool,  
You are my all in all

**Chorus**  
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!  
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!
