**Verse 1**  
Our God is far greater than words can make known.  
Exalted and Holy, He reigns on His throne,  
In infinite splendor He rules over all.  
Yet He feeds the poor sparrows,  
and He knows when they fall.

**Chorus**  
His power is great and will ever endure.  
His wisdom is peaceable, gentle and pure.  
But greater than all these glories I see,  
Is the glorious promise that He cares for me.

**Verse 2**  
He rides the wild heavens, He strides to the sea.  
The high mountain trembles to hear His decree.  
His voice with great thundering sounds from above.  
But to His own dear children, He whispers His love

**(Chorus)**
