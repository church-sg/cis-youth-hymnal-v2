**Verse 1**  
Who shall not fear Your name, O King?  
O Lord of all the earth?  
For this is Your rightful due.  
In all the kingdoms of the world,  
The name of Jesus stands alone  
For there is none like You!

**Verse 2**  
Who shall not honour You, O King?  
O Lord of all the earth?  
For this is Your rightful due.  
In all the kingdoms of the world,  
The name of Jesus stands alone  
For there is none like You!

**Verse 3**  
Who shall not worship You, O King?  
O Lord of all the earth?  
For this is Your rightful due.  
In all the kingdoms of the world,  
The name of Jesus stands alone  
For there is none like You!

**Chorus**  
Who shall not fear Your Name?  
Who shall not honour You?  
Who shall not worship Christ - the King of Glory?  
Who shall not fear Your Name?  
Who shall not honour You?  
Who shall not worship Christ the Lord of all?

**(Repeat Stanza 1)**

The name of Jesus stands alone  
For there is none like You!
