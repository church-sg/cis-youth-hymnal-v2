**Verse 1**  
Lord I come to You  
Let my heart be changed, renewed  
Flowing from the grace  
That I’ve found in You.  
And Lord I’ve come to know  
The weaknesses I see in me  
Will be stripped away  
By the pow’r of Your love.

**Chorus**  
Hold me close,  
Let Your love surround me.  
Bring me near,  
Draw me to Your side.  
And as I wait  
I’ll rise up like an eagle  
And I will soar with You,  
Your spirit leads me on  
In the pow’r of Your love.

**Verse 2**  
Lord unveil my eyes,  
Let me see You face to face,  
The knowledge of Your love  
As You live in me.  
Lord renew my mind  
As Your will unfolds in my life  
In living every day  
By the pow’r of Your love.
