**Chorus**  
A common love for each other,  
A common gift to the Savior,  
A common bond holding us to the Lord.  
A common strength when we’re weary,  
A common hope for tomorrow,  
A common joy in the truth of God’s Word.

**Verse 1**  
In His family, we can meet each one’s needs,  
We can light each one’s path,  
We can bear each one’s grief.  
As His children,  
We can comfort each care,  
We can build each one’s faith,  
We can work, we can share.

**Verse 2**  
In His family, all the love that we show,  
All the help that we give,  
All the life we bestow,  
As His children,  
They’re an off’ring we make,  
Not expecting return,  
Just a gift for His sake.

_(C.F. Brown / Ref: Romans 12:4–16)_
