**Verse 1**  
O come, let us sing unto the Lord,  
Let us make a joyful noise  
To the rock of our salvation.  
O come, let us sing unto the Lord,  
Let us make a joyful noise  
To the rock of our salvation.

**Chorus**  
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving,  
And make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.  
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

**Verse 2**  
In His hands are the deep places of the earth:  
The strength of the hills is His also.  
The sea is His, and He made it:  
And His hands formed the dry land,  
And His hands formed the dry land.

**Verse 3**  
O come, let us worship and bow down:  
Let us kneel before the Lord, the Lord our maker.  
For He is our God;  
And we are the people of His pasture,  
And the sheep of His hand.
