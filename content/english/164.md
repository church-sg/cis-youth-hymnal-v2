**Chorus**  
Be it unto me  
According to Your Word,  
According to Your promises,  
I can stand secure;  
Carve upon my heart  
The truth that sets me free,  
According to Your Word, O Lord,  
Be it unto me.

**Verse 1**  
You promised Your blood will deliver,  
Lord, we believe it’s true;  
You’ve promised us joy like a river,  
Lord, we receive it from You.  
These things You have spoken and  
You’re bringing to pass;  
This world’s disappearing,  
But Your Word will last.  
So, ... **(Chorus)**

**Verse 2**  
You promised to car-ry our sor-rows,  
Lord, we believe it’s true;  
You’ve promised unending tomorrows,  
Lord, we receive them from You.  
You’ll be our provider,  
In Your Word it’s revealed;  
By the stripes that you bore, Lord,  
We have been healed.  
So, ... **(Chorus)**
