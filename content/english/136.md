**Verse 1**  
Come you weary heart now to Jesus  
Come you anxious soul now and see  
There is perfect love and comfort in your tears  
Rest here in His wondrous peace  

**Chorus**  
Oh the Goodness, the Goodness of Jesus  
Satisfied he is all that I need  
May it be, come what may, that I rest all my days  
In the Goodness of Jesus  

**Verse 2**  
Come find what this world cannot offer  
Come and find your joy here complete  
Taste the living water, never thirst again  
Rest here in His wondrous peace  

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
Come and find your hope now in Jesus  
He is all he said he would be  
Grace is overflowing from the Saviourâ€™s heart  
Rest here in His wondrous peace  

**(Chorus x2)**

**Tag**  
May it be, come what may, that I rest all my days  
In the Goodness of Jesus
