**Verse 1**  
I’m singing for my Lord  
Everywhere I go,  
Singing of His wondrous love  
That the world may know  
How He saved a wretch like me  
By His death on Calvary -  
I’m singing for my Lord  
Everywhere I go.

**Verse 2**  
I’m singing, but sometimes  
Heavy is the load  
For this world is not a friend  
To the grace of God;  
Yet I’ll sing the whole day long,  
For He fills my heart with song,  
I’m singing for my Lord  
Everywhere I go.

**Verse 3**  
I’m singing for the lost  
Just because I know  
Jesus Christ, whose precious blood  
Washes white as snow;  
If my songs to Him can bring  
Some lost soul I’ll gladly sing -  
I’m singing for my Lord  
Everywhere I go.

**Verse 4**  
I’m singing, for the saints  
As they journey home;  
Soon they’ll reach the happy land  
Where they’ll never roam,  
And with me they’ll join and sing  
Praises to our Lord and King -  
I’m singing for my Lord  
Everywhere I go.
