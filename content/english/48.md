**Verse 1**  
‘Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,  
Step by step and day by day;  
Stepping in His very footprints,  
Walking with Him all the way.

**Chorus**  
Step by step, step by step,  
I would walk with Jesus,  
All the day, all the way,  
Keeping step with Jesus.

**Verse 2**  
‘Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,  
Leaning hard upon His arm,  
Following closely where He leads us,  
None can hurt and naught can harm.

**Verse 3**  
Step by step I’ll walk with Jesus,  
Just a moment at a time,  
Heights I have not wings to soar to,  
Step by step my feet can climb.

**Verse 4**  
All the way I’ll walk with Jesus,  
Through the sunshine, through the gloom,  
Though His blood-marked steps may lead me  
To the garden, to the tomb.

**Verse 5**  
Here a while we walk with Jesus,  
But the time will not be long  
Till the night shall change to morning,  
And the sorrow into song.

**Verse 6**  
Then, with all who walked with Jesus,  
We shall walk with Him in white,  
While He turns our grief to gladness,  
And our darkness into light.

**Verse 7**  
Jesus, keep me closer – closer,  
Step by step, and day by day;  
Stepping in Thy very footprints,  
Walking with Thee all the way.
