**Verse 1**  
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness  
And I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly trust in Jesus name  
**(Repeat Verse 1)**

**Chorus**  
Christ alone, cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Savior's love  
Through the storm  
He is Lord, Lord of all

**Verse 2**  
When darkness seems to hide His face  
I rest on His unchanging grace  
In every high and stormy gale  
My anchor holds within the veil  
My anchor holds within the veil

**Chorus**  
Christ alone, cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Savior's love  
Through the storm  
He is Lord, Lord of all  
He is Lord, Lord of all.  
**(Repeat Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
When He shall come with trumpet sound  
Oh, may I then in Him be found  
Dressed in His righteousness alone  
Faultless, stand before the throne

**(Chorus)**
