**Verse 1**  
Therefore being justified by faith,  
We have peace with God,  
Through our Lord Jesus Christ -

**Chorus**  
Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,  
Which is given, which is given,  
Unto us, to us, to us.

**Verse 2**  
God had commended His love towards us,  
In that while we were sinners, Christ died for us -

_(Ref: Romans 5:1)_
