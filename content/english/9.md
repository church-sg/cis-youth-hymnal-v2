**Verse**  
From the rising of the sun,  
to the going down of the same,  
the Lord's name is to be praised!

**(Repeat Verse)**

**Chorus**  
Praise ye the Lord!  
Praise ye all ye servants of the Lord!  
Praise the name of the Lord!  
Blessed be the name of the Lord,  
From this time forth, and forevermore!
