**Verse 1**  
Jesus shall take the highest honour  
Jesus shall take the highest praise  
Let all the earth join heav’n in exalting  
The name which is above all other names.

**Verse 2**  
Let’s bow the knee in humble adoration  
For at His name every knee must bow  
Let every tongue confess  
He is Christ, God’s only Son  
Sovereign Lord, we give you glory now.

**Chorus**  
For all honour and blessing and power  
Belongs to you, belongs to you.  
All honour and blessing and power.  
Belongs to you, belongs to you,  
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.

_(Chris Bowater)_
