**Verse 1**  
He is Alpha and Omega,  
The beginning and the end.  
He’s behind me, He’s before me,  
He’s ever my friend.  
Whatever I do, wherever I go  
Jesus is my source and my goal.

**Verse 2**  
You are Alpha and Omega,  
The beginning and the end.  
You’re behind me, You’re before me,  
You’re ever my friend.  
Whatever I do, wherever I go,  
You are my source and my goal.

_(Ane Warner & Sherry Saunders)_
