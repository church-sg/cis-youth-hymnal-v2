**Verse**  
By Your love You’ve shown the way;  
By Your grace I have been saved,  
Jesus, You have blessed me everyday.  
In my life I have been weary,  
You remind me of Your glory;  
You have changed my life in every way.

**Chorus**  
I am a new creation,  
When I place my life into Your hands  
‘Cause Jesus with Your love  
You’ve made me whole.

I lift my hands in worship;  
I live my life to bring You joy,  
I know that in Your love I will be whole.

_(Steven Wee)_
