**Verse 1**  
Hide me now,  
Under Your wings.  
Cover me within Your mighty Hands.

**Chorus**  
When the oceans rise and thunders roar,  
I will soar with You above the storm.  
Father, You are King over the floods.  
I will be still and know You are God.

**Verse 2**  
Find rest my soul,  
In Christ alone.  
Know His pow'r  
In quietness and trust.
