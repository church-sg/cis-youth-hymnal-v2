**Verse 1**  
Who has held the oceans in his hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at his voice  
All creation rises to rejoice  
  
**Chorus**  
Behold our God, seated on his throne  
Come, let us adore him  
Behold our king, nothing can compare  
Come, let us adore him  
  
**Verse 2**  
Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of his words?  
Who can teach, the one who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?  
  
**(Chorus)**  
  
**Verse 3**  
Who has felt the nails upon his hands?  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man  
God eternal, humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign  
  
**(Chorus)**  
  
**Bridge**  
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)  
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)  
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)  
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill-)  
  
**(Chorus)**
