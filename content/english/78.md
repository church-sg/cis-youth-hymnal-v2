**Verse 1**  
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart -  
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art;  
Thou my best thought, by day or by night -  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

**Verse 2**  
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word –  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son –  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

**Verse 3**  
Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise –  
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;  
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart –  
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

**Verse 4**  
High King of heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach heaven’s joys,  
O bright heav’n’s Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

_(Mary E. Byrne, Eleanor H. Hull, Irish hymn c. 8th century)_
