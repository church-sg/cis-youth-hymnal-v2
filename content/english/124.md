**Verse 1**  
Restore, O Lord, the honor of Your name,  
In works of sov’reign power  
Come shake the earth again,  
That men may see  
And come with rev’rent fear  
To the living God  
whose kingdom shall outlast the years.

**Verse 2**  
Restore, O Lord, in all the earth Your fame,  
And in our time revive  
The church that bears Your name.  
And in Your anger,  
Lord, remember mercy,  
O living God  
whose mercy shall outlast the years.

**Verse 3**  
Bend us, O Lord, where we are hard and cold,  
In Your refiner’s fire  
Come purify the gold.  
Through suffering comes  
And evil crouches near,  
Still our living God  
Is reigning, He is reigning here.

**(Repeat and end with Stanza 1)**
