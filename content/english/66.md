**Verse 1**  
Trust in the Lord, and do not be discouraged,  
Trust in the Lord, and stop that feeling blue,  
Trust in the Lord and you will be encouraged,  
For Jesus cares for you.

**Verse 2**  
Trust in the Lord, and not in any fable,  
Trust in the Lord, and find Him wholly true,  
Trust in the Lord, and know that He is able  
To fill your whole life through.

**Verse 3**  
Trust in the Lord, and not in men or nation,  
Trust in the Lord, as Saviour, Lord and King,  
Trust in the Lord for full and free salvation,  
And lift your heart and sing.

**Verse 4**  
Trust in the Lord, faith is a great adventure,  
Trust in the Lord, and never cease to pray,  
Trust in the Lord, for all the unknown future,  
Today and every day!

_(R. McCurdy Jones)_
