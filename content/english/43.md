**Verse 1**  
My heart longs for You, my Saviour.  
I would follow You, my Lord.  
Your kindness and love are vast as the skies.  
Your faithfulness never dies.  
My God and my King, Your great name I sing.  
My off'ring of praise I bring.

**Chorus**  
Jesus, O Jesus, I give You my life.  
Jesus, O Jesus, I give You my life.

**Verse 2**  
My soul contemplates Your glory.  
I worship in holy awe.  
In quietness and in confident trust,  
I rest in all that You are.  
I'll sing to the world Your glory and grace  
Until I behold Your face.

_(Leila Hamrat & Claude Fraysse)_
