**Verse**  
I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart,  
I will enter His courts with praise.  
I will say this is the day that the Lord has made,  
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.  
  
**Chorus**  
He has made me glad, He has made me glad,  
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
