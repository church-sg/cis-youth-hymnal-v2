**Verse 1**  
Lord, I come before Your throne of grace  
I find rest in Your presence,  
And fullness of Joy  
In worship and wonder  
I behold Your face  
Singing what a faithful God have I  
  
**Chorus**  
What a faithful God have I  
What a faithful God  
What a faithful God have I  
Faithful in every way  
  
**Verse 2**  
Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry  
Through the storm Youre the beacon  
My song in the night  
In the shelter of Your wings  
Hear my hearts reply  
Singing what a faithful God have I  
  
**(Chorus)**  
  
**Verse 3**  
Lord all sovereign  
Granting peace from heaven  
Let me comfort those who suffer  
With the comfort You have given  
I will tell of Your great love  
For as long as i live  
Singing what a faithful God have I  
  
**(Chorus)**
