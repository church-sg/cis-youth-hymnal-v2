**Verse 1**  
Reconciled, i’m reconciled,  
I’m reconciled to God for ever;  
know he took away my sin,  
I know his love will leave me never.  
Reconciled, I am his child,  
I know it was on me he smiled;  
I’m reconciled, I’m reconciled to God.  
Hallelujah!  
  
**Verse 2**  
I’m justified, I’m justified,  
it’s just as if I’d never sinned,  
and once I knew such guilty fear,  
but now I know his peace within me.  
Justified, I’m justified,  
it’s all because my Jesus died;  
I’m justified, I’m justified by God.  
Hallelujah!  
  
**Verse 3**  
I’ll magnify, I’ll magnify,  
I’ll magnify his name for ever;  
wear the robe of righteousness  
and bless the name of Jesus, Saviour;  
magnify the One who died,  
the One who reigns for me on high;  
I’ll magnify, I’ll magnify my God.
