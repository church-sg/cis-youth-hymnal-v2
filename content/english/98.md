I may be alone, but I am not lonely,  
For I have God with me,  
That’s what really matters,  
Though I be far from home,  
Yet home’s still inside me,  
For I have God with me, and I am with my God.  
The Lord is with me, the Lord is with me,  
Day and night, He’s my guide,  
He is always near. (He’s here!)  
The Lord is with me, the Lord is with me,  
When I wake, in my dreams,  
He is there with me!
