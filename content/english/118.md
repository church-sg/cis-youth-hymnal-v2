**Verse 1**  
Light of the world  
You stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore You  
Hope of a life spent with You

**Chorus**  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me

**Verse 2**  
King of all days  
Oh so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly You came to the earth You created  
All for loves sake became poor

**(Chorus)**

**Bridge (x2)**  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross

**(Chorus)**

_(Tim Hughes)_
