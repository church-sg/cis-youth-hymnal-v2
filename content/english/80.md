**Verse**
I will give thanks to Thee,  
O Lord, among the peoples.  
I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.  
For Thy steadfast love is great,  
Is great to the heavens,  
And Thy faithfulness,  
Thy faithfulness to the clouds.

**Chorus**
Be exalted, O God,  
Above the heavens,  
Let Thy glory be over all the earth.  
Be exalted, O God,  
Above the heavens,  
Let Thy glory be over all the earth.

_(Brent Chambers / Ref: Psalm 57:9-11;Psalm 97:9)_
