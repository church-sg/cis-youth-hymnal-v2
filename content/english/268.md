**Verse 1**  
Dearest Lord, You’ve called us here,  
And opened up Your heart.  
Oh the joy to hear Your call  
And enter in the Ark.  
Saving us from day to day,  
O Lord, this is Your way.  
In Yourself we stay afloat  
Above the wicked age today.

**Chorus**  
Thank You, Lord, in Your eyes, we find grace.  
And with opened hearts we come to You.  
Regardless what our friends might say to us or do,  
O Lord Jesus, we love You.

**Verse 2**  
Seeking of this age to taste,  
And of it have a part.  
If we only knew, dear Lord,  
The ways we grieve Your heart.  
We would come and turn to You  
With a repenting heart,  
And would give ourselves to be  
With You, O Lord, inside the Ark.

**Verse 3**  
Praise the Lord, we’re safe in You,  
Outside death-waters pour.  
Many things that I once loved  
Are on the ocean floor.  
Keep us open to You Lord,  
Don’t let us miss the mark.  
Hallelujah, Praise the Lord!  
We’re here within the church, the Ark.
