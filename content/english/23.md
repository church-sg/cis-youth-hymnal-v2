**Verse 1**  
In eternity past,  
For His glorious purpose,  
God the Father elected us in His love.  
Thus the Gospel did come,  
At the time He appoints,  
To turn us to the Lord,  
From all idols we had.

**Chorus 1**  
From darkness into light,  
From idols unto God,  
A true and living God,  
We are called to serve!

**Verse 2**  
We are called to be saints,  
Through His life He imparts,  
Separating us from everything unto God.  
'Tis His purpose to sanctify us to Himself,  
From our spirit to our entire being.

**Chorus 2**  
To live a holy life  
Unto our Lord.  
Partaking of His life,  
Christ to express!
