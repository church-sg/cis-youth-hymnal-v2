**Verse 1**  
On bended knee I come,  
With a humble heart I come,  
Bowing down before Your holy throne.  
Lifting holy hands to You,  
As I pledge my love anew;  
I worship You in spirit, I worship You in truth,  
Make my life a holy praise unto You.

**Verse 2**  
On bended knee we come,  
With a humble heart we come,  
Bowing down before Your holy throne.  
Lifting holy hands to You,  
As we pledge our love anew;  
We worship You in spirit, we worship You in truth,  
Make our lives a holy praise unto You.
