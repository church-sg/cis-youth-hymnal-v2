**Verse 1**  
Amid the trials that I meet,  
Amid the thorns that pierce my feet,  
One thought remains supremely sweet --  
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

**Chorus**  
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!  
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!  
What need I fear when Thou art near,  
And thinkest, Lord, of me!

**Verse 2**  
The cares of life come thronging fast,  
Upon my soul their shadows cast;  
Their gloom reminds my heart at last  
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

**Verse 3**  
Let shadows come, let shadows go,  
Let life be bright, or dark with woe,  
I am content, for this I know  
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
