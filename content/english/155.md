**Verse 1**  
How can I say thanks  
For the things You have done for me -  
Things so undeserved,  
Yet You give to prove Your love for me?  
The voices of a million angels  
Could not express my gratitude -  
All that I am and ever hope to be,  
I owe it all to Thee.

**Refrain**  
To God be the glory,  
To God be the glory;  
To God be the glory  
For the things He has done.  
With His blood He has saved me;  
With His pow’r He has raised me;  
To God be the glory  
For the things He has done.

**Verse 2**  
Just let me live my life;  
Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee.  
And should I gain any praise,  
Let it go to Calvary.

**Refrain**  
With His blood He has saved me;  
With His pow’r He has raised me;  
To God be the glory  
For the things He has done
