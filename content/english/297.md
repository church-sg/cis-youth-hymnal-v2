**Verse 1**  
Above all powers, above all kings,  
Above all nature, and all created things;  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,  
You were here before the world began.

**Verse 2**  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,  
Above all wonders the world has ever known;  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,  
There's no way to measure what You're worth.

**Chorus**  
Crucified, and laid behind a stone  
You lived to die, rejected and alone.  
Like a rose trampled on the ground,  
You took the fall, and thought of me -  
Above all.

**(Repeat Verses 1 & 2)**

Crucified, laid behind a stone.  
You lived to die, rejected and alone.  
Like a rose trampled on the ground,  
You took the fall, and thought of me -  
Above all.  
Like a rose trampled on the ground,  
You took the fall, and thought of me -  
Above all.
