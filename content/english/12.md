**Verse**  
For Thou, Lord, art high above all the earth.  
Thou art exalted far above all gods.  
For Thou, Lord, art high above all the earth.  
Thou art exalted far above all gods.

**Chorus**  
I exalt Thee. I exalt Thee.  
I exalt Thee, O Lord.  
I exalt Thee. I exalt Thee.  
I exalt Thee, O Lord.
