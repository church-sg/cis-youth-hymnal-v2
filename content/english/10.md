**Verse**  
He is my everything, He is my All.  
He is my everything, both great and small.  
He gave His Life for me, made everything new.  
He is my everything, now how about you?

**Chorus**  
Like honey in the rock,  
Sweet honey in the rock,  
For He tastes like honey in the rock.  
Oh taste and see that the Lord is good,  
For He tastes like honey in the rock.
