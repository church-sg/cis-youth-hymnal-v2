**Verse 1**  
Come ye beloved of the Lord  
And consider all the love  
That the Father has poured out on you.  
With joyful hearts in one accord  
Come and look upon the love  
Of the One who gave His all for you.

**Chorus**  
Our God withheld not His own Son,  
The treasure of His heart,  
Poured out for you.  
Since He already gave His Son,  
What now will He withhold  
From you, His own?

**Verse 2**  
My friend, consider then the price  
That so willingly He paid  
To redeem and win you back to Him.  
Consider how then you will live  
And just how to spend the days  
And the freedom He has won for you.

**Verse 3**  
With all the treasures of His throne  
Of the earth, and of the sky  
And of the universe beyond,  
Our Father gave instead His Son  
Counting His worth far beyond  
All the treasures of His Kingdom home.
