**Chorus**  
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet  
And a light unto my path.  
**(2x)**

**Verse 1**  
When I feel afraid, think I’ve lost my way,  
Still You’re there right beside me.  
And nothing will I fear as long as You are near.  
Please be near me to the end.

**Verse 2**  
I will not forget Your love for me, and yet  
My heart forever is wandering.  
Jesus be my guide and hold me to Your side,  
And I will love You to the end.

_(Amy Grant & Michael Smith / Ref: Psalm 119:105)_
