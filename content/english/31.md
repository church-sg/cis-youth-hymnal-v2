**Verse 1**  
When I’ve run the race before me,  
And have fought to victory,  
I’ll be raptured to the glory of the Lord.  
When I’ve kept the faith at any cost  
The Holy city then;  
I’ll receive as my reward.

**Chorus 1**  
I’ll be raptured into glory  
In the Holy City dwell –  
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem.  
With the overcomers shouting;  
How our praises then will swell,  
In the New Jerusalem.  
   
**Verse 2**  
As a pilgrim here I wander;  
While afflicted, I rejoice;  
For a better land I soon expect to see.  
Though all others seek for earthly gain,  
The Holy City e’er  
Will my aspiration be.

**Verse 3**  
Though my feet are often wearied  
On the rough and rugged path,  
Just by thinking of that City, I’m restored;  
Though my eyes be filled with tears,  
My heart will evermore be fixed  
On that City, my reward.

**Verse 4**  
With strong purpose I now wrestle,  
And I run toward the goal;  
I pursue the prize, God’s highest to obtain;  
Pressing forward toward the mark,  
I run forgetting all behind,  
Thus the Holy City gain. (Chorus 2)

**Chorus 2**  
By His love and through His grace I’ll  
In the Holy City live –  
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;  
All saints leaping, singing, shouting  
To the Lord their praises give,  
In the New Jerusalem.
