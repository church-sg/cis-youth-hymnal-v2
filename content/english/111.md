**Verse 1**  
Lord, I love You more and more each day.  
Lord, I love You more this very day.  
I can’t live without You anymore.  
I can’t make it like I did before.

**Verse 2**  
Oh, those years when I was void of You.  
Lord, You rescued me when I was through.  
When I reminisce those other years,  
Emptiness, heartaches, and many tears.

**Chorus**  
Lord, I do love You more everyday.  
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.

**verse 3**  
Oh, that thirst that gnawed me deep within:  
Drove me looking for sa-tisfaction.  
Oh, the many things that I have tried:  
Left me thirsting and dissa-tisfied.

**Verse 4**  
In this endless search for something new,  
All the time this cry was just for You.  
I was blind in trying many things  
‘Till I drank You as my liv-ing Spring.

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 5**  
Lord, You came and filled my inmost being.  
You’re the sweetest satisfac-tion.  
You’re the Spirit as my everything,  
Spirit in my spirit bubbling.

**Verse 6**  
Thank You, Lord, for coming into me.  
Now You’re spreading in me constantly.  
Lord, You’re making home in all my heart,  
As my treasure filling e-very part.

**(Chorus)**
