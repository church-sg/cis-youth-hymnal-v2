With my lips I will bless You.  
With my mouth Iâ€™ll sing your praise.  
With my eyes I long to see You.  
Show me your face.  
With my ears I long to hear You.  
With my hands I long to touch You.  
With all my heart I surrender to You.

Let all that is within me bless your holy name.  
Let all that is within me bless your holy name.

_(David Campbell)_
