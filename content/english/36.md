**Verse 1**  
Jesus, stand among us at the meeting of our lives.  
Be our sweet agreement at the meeting of our eyes.

**Chorus**  
O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here.  
Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.

**Verse 2**  
So to You we're gathering out of each and every land,  
Christ, the love between us at the joining of our hands.

_(Graham Kendrick)_
