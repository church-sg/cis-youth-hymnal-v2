**Chorus**  
Bless the Lord, O my soul,  
O my soul, worship His holy Name.  
Sing like never before, O my soul.  
I’ll worship Your holy Name.

**Verse 1**  
The sun comes up, it’s a new day dawning;  
It’s time to sing Your song again.  
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,  
Let me be singing when the evening comes.

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 2**  
You’re rich in love and You’re slow to anger,  
Your Name is great and Your heart is kind;  
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing,  
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
And on that day when my strength is failing,  
The end draws near and my time has come;  
Still my soul sings Your praise unending,  
Ten thousand years and then forevermore.

**(Chorus) x2**
