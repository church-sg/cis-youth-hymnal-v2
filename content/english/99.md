Though my days, be dark and sullen,  
In my prison, hopelessness looms,  
Yet I'll wait in anticipation,  
For my God, He will save.  
Though my deeds, may be forgotten,  
And my dreams, seem so far away,  
But I'll learn, I'll learn to wait and pray,  
For my God, He will save.  
   
I will wait, I will stand,  
Not bow down, to fate of man,  
For I know, He has a greater plan –  
It's written in the stars, and revealed in my dreams –  
So I'll wait, I will stand,  
Till He comes, reach for my hand,  
Pull me up, to a higher place,  
That I may rest, in His embrace.

_(Lim Kai Seong)_
