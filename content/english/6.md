**Verse 1**  
From the time I spoke Your name  
Lord, my life's not been the same  
Since I called on the only one who'd saved me.  
When forsaken, in despair -  
Who'd have thought that You'd be there!  
Now I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!

All my friends might think it's square -  
Since I touch You I don't care -  
For I've found You're the only life worth living.  
Though some mock and criticize,  
Lord, they just don't realize,  
That I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!

**Chorus**  
Now my eyes begin to see  
I'm living as I ought to be,  
As this turning, burning God moves in my heart  
I don't care now how I feel.  
I just know that this is real,  
And I know, Oh Jesus, You're alive!

**Verse 2**  
It's no statue that I call,  
Not a picture on the wall  
But a person who lives His life within me.  
Wish they'd told me long before  
All You want's an open door  
And that really, Jesus, You're alive!

**(Repeat Chorus)**

I don't care now how I feel.  
I just know that this is real,  
And I know, oh Jesus, You're alive!
