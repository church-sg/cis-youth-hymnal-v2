**Verse**  
While others build with hay,  
And think that all is gay,  
I choose to be at bay  
To let Christ shine His ray  
To let Him mould as clay  
And walk the narrow way  
To let Him mould as clay  
And walk the narrow way.

**Chorus**  
My answer would be nay,  
When Satan bid me stray.  
I'll do as Jesus say  
My cross on me to lay.

The hard way I will stay,  
The high price I will pay  
And take the crown that day  
And take the crown that day.
