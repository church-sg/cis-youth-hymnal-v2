**Verse 1**  
I will extol Thee, O LORD, for Thou hast lifted me up,  
And hast not let my enemies rejoice over me.  
O LORD my God, I cried to Thee,  
I cried to Thee for help and Thou didst heal me.

**Chorus**  
For His anger is but for a moment,  
His favor is for a lifetime;  
Weeping may last for the night,  
But a shout of joy comes in the morning.

**Verse 2**  
O LORD, Thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol;  
Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.  
Sing praise to the LORD you His godly ones,  
And give thanks, give thanks to His holy name.

**(Repeat Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me.  
Thou hast put off my sackcloth;  
Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me,  
And girded me with gladness;  
To the end my glory may sing praise unto Thee,  
And not be silent. O LORD my God,  
I will give thanks unto Thee forever.

_(Ref: Psalm 30)_
