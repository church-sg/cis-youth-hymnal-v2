**Verse**  
You are the Lord in whom I can trust  
You are the Rock I can stand upon.  
Every step of the way,  
You take my hand and say,  
You will always be here right beside me,  
When I call on You, I know You’ll come to me.

**Chorus**  
You are my Lord, in whom I can trust;  
You are my fortress,  
You’re my deliverer,  
My shield, my strength.  
For all of my days, I place my hope in Jesus,  
Who loved me with His life  
The Rock of my salvation in whom I can trust.
