**Verse 1**  
When'er I call Lord Jesus  
Sure it sets my heart aglow;  
Just to feel His life arising  
That Christ in me may grow.  
Just call with us, "Lord Jesus"  
It's the greatest joy on earth!  
And then Christ will come into you,  
And you'll have another birth.

**Verse 2**  
Just call with us, "Lord Jesus"  
He will surely set you free,  
If your heart is far, far from Him  
Whenever you may be.  
We simply call upon Him,  
No matter where we are.  
And calling thus, He enters,  
Oh, He's never very far.

**Verse 3**  
Just call upon our Saviour,  
Sure He'll hear you every time.  
Lean your weary head upon Him  
And rest in sweet recline.  
For He is our strong fortress,  
Our peace, our joy, our rest.  
When we taste the grace of Jesus,  
Sure we're tasting the very best.

**Verse 4**  
The best is just Himself now,  
And Himself He freely gave.  
So let's open up to Him now,  
And by His life be saved.  
And when He comes to meet us,  
As His bride we'll ready be.  
If today He grows within us,  
We shall then His glory see.
