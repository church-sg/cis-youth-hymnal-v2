**Verse**  
You are the peace that guards my heart,  
My help in time of need;  
You are the hope that leads me on,  
And brings me to my knees.  
For there I find You waiting,  
And there I find release;  
So, with all my heart Iâ€™ll worship,  
And unto You I'll sing.

**Chorus**  
For You alone deserve all glory,  
For You alone deserve all praise;  
Father, we worship and adore You.  
Father, we long to see Your face.  
For You alone deserve all glory,  
For You alone deserve all praise;  
Father, we love You,  
And we worship You this day.
