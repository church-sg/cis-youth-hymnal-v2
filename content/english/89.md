**Verse 1**  
More of our hearts, dear Lord, we’d give You now,  
That You may grow therein and gain more room.  
All is waste, Lord, only You are gain,  
Our hearts cry out until in us You reign.

We leave behind all that distracts,  
All that draws away our e Cyes.  
We give heed to Your word  
Till You blossom in our hearts.

All unwillingness You overcome,  
We enter in Your rest, in You we trust.  
Lord, our hearts are wholly Yours,  
Come engrave Your name on us,  
We want to live You out more.

**Verse 2**  
Lord, don’t allow us to go our own way,  
Without reluctance, we will choose Your way.  
We say “amen” when You are speaking, Lord.  
Yes, work in us, we pray, renew our hearts.

Lord, we give to You our hearts  
For Your house on earth to build.  
You will live therein  
And give to us Your own pure being.

Lord, touch our sprits more from day to day  
Forgetting all; we just run after You.  
We want to know You more each day.  
Only see You, Christ, our aim,  
We want to live You out more.
