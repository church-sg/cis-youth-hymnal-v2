**Verse**  
When it’s all been said and done  
There is just one thing that matters  
Did I do my best to live for truth?  
Did I live my life for You?

When it’s all been said and done  
All my treasures will mean nothing  
Only what I’ve done for love’s reward  
Will stand the test of time.

**Chorus**  
Lord, Your mercy is so great  
That You look beyond our weakness  
And find purest gold in miry clay  
Turning sinners into saints

I will always sing Your praise  
Here on earth and ever after  
For You’ve shown me Heaven’s my true home  
When it’s all been said and done  
You’re my life when life is done.

Lord I’ll live my life for You.
