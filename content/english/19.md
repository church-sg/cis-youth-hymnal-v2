**Chorus**  
Put on the garment of praise  
For the spirit of heaviness.  
Lift up your voice to God.  
Praise with the spirit and with understanding.  
Oh, magnify the Lord.

**Verse 1**  
All you that mourn in Zion,  
I have authority  
To appoint unto you in Zion  
Oil of joy that will set you free.

**Verse 2**  
Lift up the hands that hang down.  
Lift up the voice now still.  
Give unto God continuous praise.  
Sing forth from Zionâ€™s hill.

**Verse 3**  
Sing to Yahweh, hallelujah.  
Worship and praise our God.  
Praise and adore Him.  
Bow down before Him.  
Oh, magnify the Lord.

_(David Ingals)_
