**Verse 1**  
Everything I am, (Everything I am)  
Everything I’ll be, (Everything I’ll be)  
I give it to You, Lord, (I give it to You Lord)  
And do it thankfully. (Thankfully)

**Chorus**  
Every song I sing,  
Every praise I bring,  
Everything I do, is a gift to You.

**Verse 2**  
Everything I am, (Everything I am)  
All You’ve given me, (All You’ve given me)  
I give it to You, Lord, (I give it to You Lord)  
And do it thankfully. (Thankfully)
