**Verse 1**  
There are some things, I may not know.  
There are some places I can’t go.  
But I am sure of this one thing,  
That God is real for I can feel Him deep within.

**Chorus**  
My God is real, real in my soul.  
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole;  
His love for me is like pure gold,  
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.

**Verse 2**  
Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn;  
All can desert and leave me alone.  
But as for me, I’ll take God’s part,  
For God is real and I can feel Him in my heart.

**Verse 3**  
I cannot tell; just how you felt,  
When Jesus took your sins away.  
But since that day, yes since that hour,  
God has been real for I can feel His Holy Power.
