**Verse**  
There is none like You,  
No one else can touch my heart like You do,  
I could search for all eternity long  
And find, there is none like You.  
  
**Chorus**  
Your mercy flows like a river wide,  
And healing comes from Your hands.  
Suffering children are safe in Your arms,  
There is none like You.  
  
**(Repeat Verse)**
