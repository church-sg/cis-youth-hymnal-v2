**Chorus**  
When I think I’m going under,  
Part the waters, Lord.  
When I feel the waves around me,  
Calm the sea.  
When I cry for help, O hear me, Lord,  
And hold out Your hand.  
Touch my life, still the raging storm in me.

**Verse 1**  
Knowing You love me  
Through the burdens I must bear,  
Hearing Your footsteps,  
Lets me know I’m in Your care,  
And in the night of my life,  
You bring the promise of day,  
Here is my hand, show me the way.

**Verse 2**  
Knowing You love me  
Helps me face another day,  
Hearing Your footsteps  
Drives the clouds and fears away,  
And in the tears of my life,  
I see the sorrow bore.  
Here is my pain, heal it once more.
