**Verse 1**  
Jesus loves me! This I know,  
For the Bible tells me so;  
Little ones to Him belong,  
They are weak, but He is strong.  
  
**Chorus**  
Yes, Jesus loves me!  
Yes, Jesus loves me!  
Yes, Jesus loves me!  
The Bible tells me so.  
  
**Verse 2**  
Jesus loves me! He who died,  
Heaven’s gate to open wide;  
He will wash away my sin,  
Let His little child come in.  
  
**Verse 3**  
Jesus, take this heart of mine,  
Make it pure and wholly Thine;  
On the cross You died for me,  
I will try to live for Thee.  
  
**Verse 4**  
Jesus loves me! He will stay  
Close beside me all the way;  
He’s prepared a home for me,  
And some day His face I’ll see.
