**Verse**  
He is my peace, who has broken down every wall.  
He is my peace, He is my peace.  
He is my peace, who has broken down every wall.  
He is my peace, He is my peace.

**Chorus**  
Cast all your care on Him,  
For He careth for you.  
He is my peace, He is my peace.  
Cast all your care on Him,  
For He careth for you.  
He is my peace, He is my peace.

_(Kandy Groves/Ref: Ephesians 2:14; 1 Peter 5:7)_
