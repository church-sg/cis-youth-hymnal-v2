**Verse**  
Shepherd of my soul,  
I give You full control,  
Wherever You may lead  
I will follow.  
I have made the choice  
To listen for Your voice,  
Wherever You may lead,  
I will go.

**Chorus**  
Be it in a quiet pasture  
Or by a gentle stream,  
The Shepherd of my soul is by my side.  
Should I face a mighty mountain  
Or a valley dark and deep  
The Shepherd of my soul  
Will be my guide.

**(Repeat Verse)**

_(Martin Nystrom / Ref: Psalm 23:2)_
