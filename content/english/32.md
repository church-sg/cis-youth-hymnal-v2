This world is not my home  
I’m just a-passing through  
My treasures are laid up  
Somewhere beyond the blue  
The angels beckon me  
from heaven’s open door  
And I can’t feel at home  
in this world any more.

Oh Lord, You know I have no friend like You.  
If heaven’s not my home,  
then Lord, what will I do?  
The angels beckon me  
from heaven’s open door,  
And I can’t feel at home  
in this world anymore.
