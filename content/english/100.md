The arms of my hands,  
They were all made strong,  
Not by man's endeavour.  
They should have been weak,  
With the many shots, of the archers.

But my hands held fast,  
I could not fail,  
I know my God will keep me in strength,  
My very arms were strengthened by His hands.

By His hands, by His hands,  
The hands of the mighty God of Jacob,  
By His hands, By His hands,  
The hands of the God of Jacob.

_(Lim Kai Seong)_
