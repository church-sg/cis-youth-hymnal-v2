**Verse 1**  
Every heart is filled with longing…  
To be free from all life’s pain.  
Yet the search through earthly pleasures  
Always ends in vain.  
Only God who made the heavens  
Can satisfy our souls…

**Chorus**  
Apart from Him and all His meaning  
All things fail, as they begin.  
And hearts deceived, can only know  
A chasing of the wind.

**Verse 2**  
All achievements, all possessions;  
All with time return to dust  
Only God can be our reason  
For deep and quiet trust  
He will guard us from the dangers  
That gladly make men fools...
