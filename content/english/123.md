**Verse 1**  
I just want to be where You are  
Dwelling daily in Your presence  
I don't want to worship from afar  
Draw me near to where You are

**Verse 2**  
I just want to be where You are  
In Your dwelling place forever  
Take me to the place where You are  
I just want to be with You

**Chorus**  
I want to be where You are, dwelling in Your presence  
Feasting at Your table, surrounded by Your glory  
In Your presence, that's where I always want to be  
I just want to be, I just want to be with You

**Bridge**  
Oh my God, You are my strength and my song  
And when I'm in Your presence  
Though I'm weak You're always strong
