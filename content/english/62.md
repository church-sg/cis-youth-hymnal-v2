**Verse 1**  
You are my strength when I am weak,  
You are the treasure that I seek,  
You are my All in All.  
Seeking you as a precious jewel,  
Lord to give up I'd be a fool,  
You are my All in All

**Chorus**  
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!  
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your Name!

**Verse 2**  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame,  
Rising again I bless Your name.  
You are my All in All.  
When I fall down, You pick me up;  
When I am dry, You fill my cup.  
You are my All in All.
