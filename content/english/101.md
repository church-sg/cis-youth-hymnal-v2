**Verse 1**  
Lord, now I see –  
You only want me to believe.  
Not to dwell  
In all my failures and defeats,  
To believe what You have done,  
Not in what I see.

**Verse 2**  
Lord, I believe  
When all around me is defeat,  
And it seems  
That nothing’s changing outwardly,  
No, I’m not discouraged  
I’m believing You.

**Verse 3**  
Yes, I believe,  
And there is no demand on me.  
Simple faith;  
Yes, that is all You want from me.  
Free from anxious doubting,  
I’m free to just believe.

**Verse 4**  
Believing You  
Because Lord, You are my success.  
When I fail,  
All I must do is just confess  
And go on enjoying You.  
I love believing You.

_(From Youth Hymnbook #216 from the Church in Fountain Valley)_
