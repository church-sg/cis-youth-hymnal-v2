**Verse 1**  
Did you ever talk to God above?  
Tell Him that you need a friend to love?  
Pray in Jesus’ name believing  
That God answers prayer.  
Have you told Him all your cares and woes?  
Every tiny little fear He knows.  
You can know He’ll always hear and  
He will answer prayer.

**Chorus**  
You can whisper in a crowd to Him.  
You can cry when you’re alone to Him  
You don’t have to pray out loud to Him;  
He knows your thoughts.  
On a lofty mountain peak, He’s there.  
In a meadow by a stream, He’s there.  
Anywhere on earth you go  
He’s been there from the start.

**Verse 2**  
Did you ever talk to God above?  
Tell Him that you need a friend to love?  
Pray in Jesus’ name believing  
That God answers prayer.  
Find the answer in His word, it’s true.  
You’ll be strong because He walks with you.  
By His faithfulness He’ll change you, too;  
God answers prayer.  
**(Fine)**
