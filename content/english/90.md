**Verse 1**  
Everyday, they pass me by  
I can see it in their eyes.  
Empty people filled with care,  
Headed who knows where.  
On they go through private pain,  
Living fear to fear.  
Laughter hides the silent cries,  
Only Jesus hears.

**Chorus**  
People need the Lord, **(2x)**  
At the end of broken dreams,  
He’s the open door.  
People need the Lord, **(2x)**  
When will we realize?  
People need the Lord.

**Verse 2**  
We are called to take His light  
To a world where wrong seems right.  
What could be too great a cost  
For sharing life with one who’s lost?  
Through His love our hearts can feel,  
All the grief they bear.  
They must hear the words of life;  
Only we can share.

**Chorus**  
People need the Lord, **(2x)**  
At the end of broken dreams,  
He’s the open door.  
People need the Lord, **(2x)**  
When will we realize?  
That we must give our lives  
For people need the Lord  
People need the Lord. **(slower as finale)**

_(Phil McHugh and Greg Nelson)_
