**Verse 1**  
Lord, fill my heart with Thy grace,  
‘Cos You’re the only one who made my soul:  
Satisfied, filled with joy and quenched my thirst.  
Oh Lord, You are the only way.

**Verse 2**  
Lord, keep me burning on and on,  
That my heart wouldn’t move away from Thee.  
Live within, Your great love and keep my all to You.  
‘Cos Lord, You are the only way.

**Verse 3**  
Lord, teach me how to follow Thee.  
That our light so shine before all men.  
That they see our good works and glorify Thee  
And Lord, You are my all in all.

_(C.H. Pang 1997)_
