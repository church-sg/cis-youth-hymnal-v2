Thy loving kindness is better than life **(2x)**  
My lips shall praise Thee,  
Thus will I bless Thee.  
Thy loving kindness is better than life.

I will lift my hands up unto Thy name **(2x)**  
My lips shall praise Thee,  
Thus will I bless Thee.  
Thy loving kindness is better than life.

_(Hugh Mitchell / Ref: Psalm 63:3,4)_
