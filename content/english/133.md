**Verse 1**  
There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies  
There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide  
Where all the love I've ever found  
Comes like a flood  
Comes flowing down  
  
**Chorus**  
At the cross  
At the cross  
I surrender my life  
I'm in awe of You  
I'm in awe of You  
Where Your love ran red  
And my sin washed white  
I owe all to You  
I owe all to You Jesus  
  
**Verse 2**  
There's a place where sin and shame are powerless  
Where my heart has peace with God and forgiveness  
Where all the love I've ever found  
Comes like a flood  
Comes flowing down  
  
**(Chorus)**  
  
**Bridge**  
Here my hope is found  
Here on holy ground  
Here I bow down  
Here arms open wide  
Here You save my life  
Here I bow down  
Here I bow down  
  
**(Chorus)**
