**Verse**  
Give thanks with a grateful heart.  
Give thanks to the Holy One.  
Give thanks because He’s given  
Jesus Christ, His Son.

**(Repeat Verse)**

**Chorus**  
And now let the weak say, “I am strong”,  
Let the poor say, “I am rich”,  
Because of what the Lord has done for us.  
And now let the weak say, “I am strong”,  
Let the poor say, “I am rich”,  
Because of what the Lord has done for us.  
Give thanks.

_(Henry Smith)_
