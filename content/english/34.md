**Verse 1**  
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. (2x)

O my God, I trust in Thee  
Let me not be ashamed,  
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

Yea, let none that wait, in Thee, be ashamed. (2x)

Show me Thy ways, teach me Thy paths. (2x)

**Verse 4**  
Remember not the sins of my youth. (2x)

**Verse 5**  
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth. (2x)

**Verse 6**  
What man is he that feareth the Lord. (2x)

**Verse 7**  
The secret of the Lord, is with them that fear Him. (2x)

Turn Thee unto me and have mercy upon me. (2x)
