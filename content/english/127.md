**Verse 1**  
My Jesus, my Savior  
Lord there is none like You  
All of my days, I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
My Comfort, my Shelter  
Tower of Refuge and Strength  
Let every breath, all that I am  
Never cease to worship You

**Chorus**  
Shout to the Lord All the earth let us sing  
Power and majesty Praise to the King  
Mountains bow down And the sea will roar  
At the sound of Your Name

I sing for joy at the work of Your hands  
Forever I’ll love You, forever I’ll stand  
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.

**Verse 2**  
My Jesus, my Savior  
Lord there is none like You  
All of my days, I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
My Comfort, my Shelter  
Tower of Refuge and Strength  
Let every breath, all that I am  
Never cease to worship You

**(Chorus)**
