**Verse 1**  
We will glorify the King of kings.  
We will glorify the Lamb;  
We will glorify the Lord of Lords,  
Who is the great “I AM”.

**Verse 2**  
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty,  
We will bow before His throne;  
We will worship Him in righteousness,  
We will worship Him alone.

**Verse 3**  
He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth,  
He is Lord of all who live;  
He is Lord above the universe,  
All praise to Him we give.

**Verse 4**  
Hallelujah to the King of kings,  
Hallelujah to the Lamb;  
Hallelujah to the Lord of lords,  
Who is the great “I AM”.
