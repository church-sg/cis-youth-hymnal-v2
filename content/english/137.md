**Verse 1**  
Lord, I love You more and_ more each day.  
Lord, I love You more this_ very day.  
I can’t live without You_ anymore.  
I can’t make it like I did_ before.  

**Verse 2**  
Oh, those years when I was_ void of You.  
Lord, You rescued me when_ I was through.  
When I reminisce those_ other years,  
Emptiness, heartaches, and ma_ny tears.  

**Chorus**  
Lord, I do love You more everyday.  
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.  

**Verse 3**  
Oh, that thirst that gnawed me_ deep within:  
Drove me looking for sa-tisfaction.  
Oh, the many things that_ I have tried:  
Left me thirsting and dissa-tisfied.  

**Verse 4**  
In this endless search for_ something new,  
All the time this cry was_ just for You.  
I was blind in trying_ many things  
‘Till I drank You as my liv-ing Spring.

**Chorus**  
Lord, I do love You more everyday.  
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.  

**Verse 5**  
Lord, You came and filled my_ inmost being.  
You’re the sweetest satis_fac-tion.  
You’re the Spirit as my_ everything,  
Spirit in my spirit bub_bling.  

**Verse 6**  
Thank You, Lord, for coming_ into me.  
Now You’re spreading in me_ constantly.  
Lord, You’re making home in_ all my heart,  
As my treasure filling e-very part.  

**Chorus**  
Lord, I do love You more everyday.  
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.
