**Verse 1**  
Who else commands all the hosts of heaven  
Who else could make every king bow down  
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles  
Only a Holy God  

**Verse 2**  
What other beauty demands such praises  
What other splendour outshines the sun  
What other majesty rules with justice  
Only a Holy God  

**Chorus**  
Come and behold Him  
The One and the Only  
Cry out, sing holy  
Forever a Holy God  
Come and worship the Holy God  

**Verse 3**  
What other glory consumes like fire  
What other power can raise the dead  
What other name remains undefeated  
Only a Holy God  

**(Chorus x2)**  

**Verse 4**  
Who else could rescue me from my failing  
Who else would offer His only Son  
Who else invites me to call Him Father  
Only a Holy God  
Only my Holy God!  

**(Chorus x2)**  

Come and worship the Holy God
