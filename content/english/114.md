**Verse 1**  
All heaven declares  
The glory of the risen Lord  
Who can compare  
With the beauty of the Lord?  
Forever He will be  
The Lamb upon the throne  
I gladly bow the knee  
And worship Him alone.

**Verse 2**  
I will proclaim  
The glory of the risen Lord  
Who once was slain  
To reconcile man to God  
Forever You will be  
The Lamb upon the throne  
I gladly bow the knee  
And worship You alone.

_(Noel and Tricia Richards / Ref: Psalm 19:1; Revelation 5:12)_
