**Verse 1**  
I do not know what lies ahead,  
The way I cannot see;  
Yet One stands near to be my guide,  
He’ll show the way to me

**Chorus**  
I know who holds the future,  
And He’ll guide me with His hand,  
With God things don’t just happen,  
Everything by Him is planned;  
So as I face tomorrow  
With its problems large and small,  
I’ll trust the God of miracles,  
Give to Him my all.

**Verse 2**  
I do not know how many days  
Of life are mine to spend;  
But One who knows and cares for me  
Will keep me to the end

**Verse 3**  
I do not know the course ahead,  
What joys and grieves are there;  
But One is near who fully knows,  
I’ll trust His loving care

_(A. B. Smith & E. Clark)_
