**Verse 1**  
A moment like this is so hard to find;  
So let me now set my heart, soul and mind,  
To commune with You in reverent prayer;  
Here, now, prostrate this portion to bear:

**Refrain 1**  
A heart to be true, A heart to be pure;  
A life to commit, With love to endure.  
If this kneeling may lead, My heart be re-phased  
With full worship, Awe and majestic praise.  
(Repeat and sing in a different tune)

**Verse 2**  
A moment like this majestic and grand;  
So let me now rise before Your throne stand,  
Worshipping You in transcendent praise;  
Here, now, proclaim (Your) amazing grace:

**Refrain 2**  
A God who forgives, A God from above  
(Yet) A God who can save, A God who does love.  
You are the One, I do not deserve;  
Yet You are there, Always gracious to me...

You are the One a God who forgives  
A God from above (Yet) a God who can save  
You are the One I do not deserve;  
Yet You are there always gracious to us.

_(Lim Kai Seong)_
