**Verse 1**  
Lord, keep my heart always true to You;  
Never backsliding, always viewing You;  
A heart that is pure, and sees only You;  
A heart that loves You, and treasures only You.

**Chorus**  
Your love constrains me to give my all to You.  
Lord I can't help it, my heart is drawn to You;  
Oh what a privilege; I give myself to You!  
I love You, Lord, dearest Lord,  
I love You, I just love You.

**Verse 2**  
Lord, keep my love burning brightly for You;  
A love never dwindling, always hot for You;  
A love shining brighter all the way for You;  
A love so fresh like the day I first touched You.

**Verse 3**  
Lord, take my life, I present it to You;  
If I had a thousand I'd pour all on You;  
Nothing withholding, my all is for You;  
My life, and my future, dear Lord, is all for You.
