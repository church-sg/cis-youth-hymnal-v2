**Verse 1**  
In the darkness we were waiting  
Without hope, without light  
'Til from Heaven You came running  
There was mercy in Your eyes  
To fulfill the law and prophets  
To a virgin came the word  
From a throne of endless glory  
To a cradle in the dirt  

**Chorus**  
Praise the Father, praise the Son  
Praise the Spirit, three in one  
God of glory, Majesty  
Praise forever to the King of Kings  
 
**Verse 2**  
To reveal the kingdom coming  
And to reconcile the lost  
To redeem the whole creation  
You did not despise the cross  
For even in your suffering  
You saw to the other side  
Knowing this was our salvation  
Jesus for our sake you died  

**(Chorus)**

**Verse 3**  
And the morning that You rose  
All of Heaven held its breath  
'Til that stone was moved for good  
For the Lamb had conquered death  
And the dead rose from their tombs  
And the angels stood in awe  
For the souls of all who'd come  
To the Father are restored  

**Verse 4**  
And the church of Christ was born  
Then the Spirit lit the flame  
Now this gospel truth of old  
Shall not kneel, shall not faint  
By His blood and in His name  
In His freedom I am free  
For the love of Jesus Christ  
Who has resurrected me  

**(Chorus)**

**Outro**  
Praise forever to the King of Kings
