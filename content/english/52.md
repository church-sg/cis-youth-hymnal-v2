**Verse 1**  
We choose the fear of the Lord. **(2x)**  
For the fear of the Lord is to hate all evil,  
We choose the fear of the Lord.

**Verse 2**  
We choose the way of the Lord. **(2x)**  
For the way of the Lord is the way of wisdom,  
We choose the way of the Lord.

**Chorus**  
He who delights in the Word of the Lord  
Shall be blessed in all of his ways.  
For the friendship of God is with those who fear Him  
So we choose the fear of the Lord.  
We choose the way of the Lord.  
We choose the Word of the Lord.

**Verse 3**  
We choose the Word of the Lord. **(2x)**  
For the Word of the Lord shall endure forever,  
We choose the Word of the Lord.

**(Chorus)**

**Finale**  
For the fear of the Lord is to hate all evil  
So we choose the fear of the Lord.  
We choose the way of the Lord.  
We choose the Word of the Lord.
