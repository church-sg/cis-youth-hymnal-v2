**Verse**  
Here I am at Your feet crying out to You  
Draw me near, hold me close  
Lord I wait on You.  
For You’re my greatest Love  
You’re my comforter and strength  
You’re the First, You’re the Last  
You’re my guiding Light

**Chorus**  
I will run, I will soar  
On eagle’s wings.  
As I wait on You, Lord,  
My strength is restored.  
Fix my eyes on You Jesus,  
As I run this race.  
Help me fight this fight of faith.
