**Chorus**  
I guess it all comes down to where your heart is.  
It's there your thoughts and feelings all begin,  
But if you never give your heart to Jesus,  
You'll never really have a part in Him.

**Verse 1**  
If your treasures are in heaven,  
Then your heart will be there too,  
And the things you say and do  
Will show Christ's love.  
But if your treasures here on earth,  
Tell me where your heart will be,  
You'll never have a part in things above.

**Verse 2**  
If your mind's set on the Spirit,  
And you're walking in God's light,  
Then the watching world will see  
Christ's love in you.  
But if your mind's set on the earth,  
And the earthly things to do,  
In poverty you'll live your whole life through.

_(Jon Sherberg / Ref: Romans 8:5)_
