**Verse 1**  
Who can stand, who can stand?  
Before the anger of the LordWho can shout, who can say?  
“I have no need of God”?

Who can fathom the power of His might?  
The greatness of His strike,  
the force of His right hand?  
Who can fathom the potter’s way with His clay?  
Who can stand against You Lord?

**Verse 2**  
Do we know or understand?  
The depth of the Love of God?  
Do we dare, can we say?  
“I have no need of His Love”?

Who can fathom the splendor of His Love?  
The visits of His grace, the saving by His hand?  
Who can fathom the thoughts of His mind?  
They are too wonderful for me!

**Refrain**  
May I start afresh  
Before You my Lord  
May I now confess  
I am nothing before You my God:  
Your word has promised;  
If I will return -  
Then You will return  
And restore me again.

Who can fathom the splendor of His Love?  
The visits of His grace, the saving by His hand?  
Who can fathom the thoughts of His mind?  
They are too wonderful for me!
