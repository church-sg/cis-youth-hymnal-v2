**Verse 1**  
Jesus Lord, I’m captured by Thy beauty,  
All my heart to Thee I open wide;  
Now set free from all religious duty,  
Only let me in Thyself abide.  
As I’m gazing here upon Thy glory,  
Fill my heart with radiancy divine;  
Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,  
Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.

**Verse 2**  
Shining One - how clear the sky above me!  
Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!  
Holy One, the flames of God consume me,  
Till my being glows with Thee alone.  
Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,  
All self-love and glory sank in shame;  
Now my heart its love and praises render,  
Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.

**Verse 3**  
Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster  
Gladly now I break in love for Thee;  
I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;  
Lord, behold, I’ve saved the best for Thee.  
Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;  
Loving Thee, I’m deeply satisfied.  
Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,  
Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.

**Verse 4**  
My Beloved, come on spices’ mountain;  
How I yearn to see Thee face to face.  
Drink, dear Lord,  
From my heart’s flowing fountain,  
Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace.  
Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,  
But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;  
Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;  
Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.
