**Verse 1**  
This world is not my home  
I’m just a-passing through  
My treasures are laid up  
Somewhere beyond the blue  
The angels beckon me from heaven’s open door  
And I can’t feel at home in this world any more.

**Verse 2**  
Oh Lord, You know I have no friend like You.  
If heaven’s not my home, then Lord, what will I do?  
The angels beckon me from heaven’s open door,  
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore.
