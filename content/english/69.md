### Version 1

Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning,  
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray;  
Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning,  
Keep me burning ‘til the break of day:

**Chorus**  
Sing Hosanna! Sing Hosanna!  
Sing Hosanna to the King of Kings!  
Sing Hosanna! Sing Hosanna!  
Sing Hosanna to the King.  
**(One group sustain “Sing” while the other sings “Sing Hosanna”)**

### Version 2

**Verse 1**: Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising,  
**Verse 2**: Give me peace in my heart, keep me resting,  
**Verse 3**: Give me love in my heart, keep me serving,

### Version 3

**Verse 1**  
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,  
What a wonderful friend is He,  
For He left all the glory of heaven,  
Came to earth to die on Calvary:  
**(Chorus as version 1)**

**Verse 2**  
He arose from the grave, Hallelujah,  
And He lives never more to die,  
At the Father’s right hand interceding,  
He will hear and heed our faintest cry:  
**(Chorus as version 1)**

**Verse 3**  
He is coming some day to receive us,  
We’ll be caught up to heaven above,  
What a joy it will be to behold Him,  
Sing forever of His grace and love:  
**(Chorus as version 1)**
