**Verse 1**  
Ancient words, long preserved  
For our walk in this world  
They resound with God’s own heart  
Oh let the ancient words impart.  
  
Words of life, words of hope  
Give us strength, help us cope  
In this world, where’er we roam  
Ancient words will guide us home.  
  
**Chorus**  
Ancient words, ever true  
Changing me and changing you  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh let the ancient words impart.  
  
**Verse 2**  
Holy words of our faith  
Handed down to this day  
Came to us through sacrifice  
Oh heed the faithful words of Christ.  
  
Holy words, long preserved  
For our walk in this world  
They resound with God’s own heart  
Oh let the ancient words impart.  
  
**(Repeat Chorus twice)**
