**Verse 1**  
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer  
There is no more for heaven now to give  
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom  
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
For my life is wholly bound to His  
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing, "All is mine"  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

**Verse 2**  
The night is dark but I am not forsaken  
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay  
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing  
For in my need, His power is displayed  
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me  
Through the deepest valley He will lead  
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

**Verse 3**  
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven  
The future sure, the price it has been paid  
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon  
And He was raised to overthrow the grave  
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated  
Jesus now and ever is my plea  
Oh the chains are released, I can sing, "I am free"  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

**Verse 4**  
With every breath I long to follow Jesus  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day I know He will renew me  
Until I stand with joy before the throne  
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him  
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
