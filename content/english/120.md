**Verse 1**  
Let me stand behind You, Lord.  
Let me wash Your feet with my tears.  
Let me wipe them with my hair.  
Let me kiss them and anoint them with the  
ointment.

I love You!  
Jesus, I love You!  
May I waste my all and life on You.  
Let me pour the ointment pure  
On Your head and on Your feet,  
On You, Most Precious One  
Because I love You.

**Verse 2**  
Let me take a pound of ointment pure  
Of great value to anoint Your feet  
And wipe them with my hair  
That the house be filled with the fragrance of the ointment.  
(Repeat Chorus 1)

**Verse 3**  
Lord, they say if You were a prophet,  
You should know who and what I am.  
I'm a sinner that toucheth You,  
A woman not worthy to anoint You.

But I love You!  
Jesus, I love You!  
You forgave me the most  
Now I love You, Lord, the most.  
Let me pour the ointment pure  
On Your head and on Your feet,  
On You, most precious one,  
Because You love me.

**Verse 4**  
Let my love from my being wash your feet  
To my glory without wipe them too.  
Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.  
All my love, Lord, and glory I'll waste on You.

I love You!  
Jesus, I love you!  
All my glory and love  
I pour and waste on You.  
Receive my ointment, Lord.  
It's all I have, dear Lord,  
For You, most precious one,  
Because I love You.

_(Luke 7:36-50)_
