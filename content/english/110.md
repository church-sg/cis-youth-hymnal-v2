**Verse 1**  
I’ve found a friend in Jesus,  
He’s everything to me,  
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;  
The Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see  
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.  
In sorrow He’s my comfort,  
In trouble He’s my stay,  
He tells me every care on Him to roll:  
He’s the Apple-tree of trees,  
The Bright and Morning Star,  
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

**Verse 2**  
He all my grief has taken,  
And all my sorrows borne;  
In temptation He’s my strong and mighty tower;  
I’ve all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn  
From my heart, and now  
He keep me by His power.  
Though all the world forsake me,  
And Satan tempt me sore,  
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:  
He’s the Apple-tree of trees,  
The Bright and Morning Star,  
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

**Verse 3**  
He’ll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,  
While I live by faith and do His blessed will;  
A wall of fire about me, I’ve nothing now to fear,  
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.  
Then sweeping up to glory  
To see His blessed face,  
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:  
He’s the Apple-tree of trees,  
The Bright and Morning Star,  
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
