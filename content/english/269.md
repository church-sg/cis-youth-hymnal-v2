**Verse 1**  
More of our hearts, dear Lord,  
We’d give You now;  
Even more ground to You, Lord, we’d allow.  
All that distracts us we’d despise,  
All that draws away our eyes –  
Lord, do fill our vision  
’Till the morning star has risen!  
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain,  
Our inward parts cry out for You to reign.  
Worthy You are our hearts to claim –  
Come, engrave on us Your name,  
We would love you, Jesus, more.

**Verse 2**  
Less we would argue, Lord,  
And go our way.  
More we would say “Amen” to what You say.  
Grant us a walk to You conformed,  
’Till our living is transformed  
We adore You, Jesus –  
May a pure love for You seize us.  
Any unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay,  
Even by faith we open, all the way –  
Rising to heights of love unknown,  
Christ our destiny alone,  
We would love you, Jesus, more.
