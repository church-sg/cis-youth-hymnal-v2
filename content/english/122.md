**Verse 1**  
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour -  
Hear my humble cry!  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

**Refrain**  
Saviour, Saviour,  
Hear my humble cry!  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

**Verse 2**  
Let me at Thy throne of mercy  
Find a sweet relief;  
Kneeling there in deep contrition -  
Help my unbelief.

**Verse 3**  
Trusting only in Thy merit,  
Would I seek Thy face;  
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,  
Save me by Thy grace.

**Verse 4**  
Thou the spring of all my comfort,  
More than life to me!  
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?  
Whom in heavâ€™n but Thee?
